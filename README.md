# Flashcards-react
This is a open source flashcards program for vocabulary terms created in ReactJS.  The program was made just as much as an educational tool to learn vocabulary as it is for me to learn ReactJS.
How to get started working on this. (must have NodeJS installed on your computer https://nodejs.org/en/)
Also have a way to compile SASS.
